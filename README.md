# Color-Identification-In-Images-For-Monochromacy

## Description

This project aims to assist individuals with Monochromacy, who perceive only 1% of colors compared to those with normal vision. The K-Means Machine Learning algorithm was used to extract and identify colors from images. The system analyzes RGB values to filter images based on specified colors, showing the top color shades in a pie chart. It then compares these shades with images to find the best matches, helping colorblind users better identify and differentiate colors.
